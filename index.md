# Project Summary

The Washington Merged Longitudinal Administrative Dataset (WMLAD), a compilation of administrative records from six state agencies, was created as a way to measure work and earnings outcomes in the state of Washington. Because administrative data is collected at an individual level, but poverty is measured on a household level, this particular research project focuses on grouping individuals into households. The goal is to design different definitions of a household and implement them on our data. Ideally they will capture a variety of household types reflecting our complex society. The resulting household groupings will be used as a baseline or reference point for future research, especially to answer questions regarding the minimum wage and household poverty. Additionally, this project aims to restructure and organize WMLAD to make this administrative data user-friendly for future researchers.
