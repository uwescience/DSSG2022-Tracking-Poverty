Eliot Stanton

**Recent Graduate, Data Science and Analytics**

*Simmons University*

Eliot (they/them) is a new graduate of Simmons University in Boston, where they studied data science. They enjoy conducting all manners of data exploration and visualization, especially using R. While at Simmons, Eliot also completed a theoretical gender studies thesis entitled “Binaries in Binary: Harmful Consequences and Radical Possibilities of Technology for Trans Liberation” and presented their work as a Keynote Speaker at the Simmons Undergraduate Symposium. During part of a COVID gap year, Eliot worked as a Civic Digital Fellow at the U.S. Census Bureau, and they have also interned at Bluebonnet Data and Bank of America. Eliot was initially interested in DSSG for the opportunity to apply technical skills in service of a meaningful cause, and they are extremely excited to work on the challenge of tracking poverty through a complex dataset. They’re also looking forward to close teamwork, mentorship, and engaging with ethical issues.

Zhaowen Guo

**Ph.D. Candidate, Political Science**

*University of Washington*

Zhaowen Guo is a Ph.D. candidate in political science and a consultant at the Center for Social Science Computation and Research (CSSCR) at the University of Washington. Prior to joining the University of Washington, she holds a master’s degree in political science at Columbia University with Chinese Government Scholarship, and a bachelor’s degree in political science at Fudan University.
Her research agenda has centered around how information and technology impact public discourses, government accountability, and political behavior. Her dissertation is exploring how a surveillance society takes root and its consequences on welfare provision and political participation in China. She is looking forward to participating in the DSSG program to leverage her inter-disciplinary experiences in data science and social science in solving real-world problems.

Betelhem Muno 

**Master of Public Health Student in Epidemiology**

*School of Public Health, University of Washington*
 
Betelhem Muno is an incoming Master of Public Health (MPH) student based out of the department of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health at University of Washington (UW). She is excited to start in the fall with the hopes of focusing on maternal and child health through an epidemiological lens. She just completed her undergraduate degree at Haverford College with a major in Environmental Studies (focusing on Environmental Health) and a minor in Health Studies. Her understanding of the ways data impacts health policies and health outcomes-in all aspects of life-pushed her to start taking data science courses to become equipped with the analytical tools needed to interpret and comprehend data. She intentionally focuses all of her work on health issues that impact under-resourced communities, especially issues that impact Black communities both in the U.S. and globally. Her interest in the intersection of data science and public health issues, and seeing the ways economical health influences every other form of health prompted her to join DSSG and her project, respectively.
